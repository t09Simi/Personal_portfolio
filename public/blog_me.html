                            <p>Hello, dear readers! Today, I want to take you on a journey into my world,
                            sharing a bit about who Iam, my passions, and my ongoing pursuit of knowledge.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p> I've always been fascinated by the ever-evolving landscape of technology and the endless
                            possibilities it holds. My journey in the world of Information Technology began 11 years ago
                            when I took my first steps into the realm of coding. Since then it has been a love-hate kind
                            of relationship.
                            </p>
                        <h2> My Academic Pursuits</h2>
                            <p> One of my greatest passion lies in the pursuit of knowledge. I did my Bachelors in Computer 
                            Engineering in India from Mumbai University, where I've delved deep into the intricacies of different technologies
                            and software side of things. Currently I'm doing my Masters in Information Technology from University of Aberdeen.
                            I have also worked in the IT industry for 4 years as a Software Developer which again fuelued my curiosoty and shaped my perspective.
                            </p>
                        <h2>Exploring my Interests</h2>
                            <p>When I'm not immersed in the digital realm, you can often find me in my house cooking, cleaning and doing the everyday chores.
                            I love to binge watch movies, listen to good music and also go to parties and dancing my heart out. I love hiking and explore nature
                            which provides me with a balance to my tech-heavy life.
                            </p>
                        <h2> Join Me On This Exciting Journey</h2>
                            <p>As I continue to explore the ever-expanding </p>
